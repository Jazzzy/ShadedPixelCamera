# ShadedPixelCamera
This camera is being developed in order to be able to have a pixel perfect game but with the option to include shaders that work in the game resolucion and in the final resolution.

Since this will be part of a bigger project some shaders will be already added.

Huge thanks to **Ryan Nielson** who made the original **PixelCamera2D**, an asset that has worked as the base for this one. The MIT license that he provided is added in the LICENSE file.

Thanks also to **J. Kyle Pittman** who explained me how some effects used for the CRT effect worked.
